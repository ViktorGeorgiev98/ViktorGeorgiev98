# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

My name is Viktor Georgiev. I am currently working as an RPA developer where I am currently working on the following:
  1/ Create new robots for automation for our client.
  2/ Fix any bugs connected to already existing ones
  3/ Develop automation testing for making sure everything works correctly.

I have studied Web Development in SoftUni Bulgaria. I have a huge interest in FrontEnd development, so this is why I studied it and I am continuing to develop my skills taking additional courses. I really like learning and working on new interesting projects so what can be found in my github profile is mostly FrontEnd. In the past 2 years I have gained huge improvement of my skills from barely kwowing how to code to sucessfully getting a job and doing side projects.

I am always opened to any interesting opportunities to develop my skillset and learn new things.
